//Adjusted bonus values and added validate function to adjust values over maxiumum allowed - Yves 12/18
/* from http://www.shadowgate.s4.bizhat.com/viewtopic.php?t=2980&mforum=shadowgate
   // going to attempt to make this fit as well as can be allowed to determine what an item's level should be based on its bonuses

   Overall directions:

   // currently this will do a valid limb check by comparing it to an item it inherits from /d/common if it's armor
   // generally the safest bet is to inherit your items from something in /d/common somewhere, and don't change the limbs

   -players currently have nine equipment slots: head, neck, torso, waist, left/right arm, left/right hand x2,
   left/right leg (or foreleg for wemic/centaur), and left/right foot (or hoof/forepaw for minotaur/wemic/centaur).
   Please ensure your items match the corresponding slot; bracers, bracelets, gloves and gauntlets should all be
   allocated to the arms slot; greaves should be on legs/forelegs; left/right hand should ONLY be used for rings
   and other trinkets - usually this will be a ROP and one other misc magical trinket.


   -all core equipment should generally pick up the standard enchantment for the level; please do not feel the need to
   downgrade enchantments anymore on "rare" item slots like boots and hats. Eg/ most L30+ areas should drop +5 items
   consistently for any slot; +2 items should not be found before around L12. The only exception here should be the
   second ring slot; if the ring/trinket you are making is not a ROP (and not locked down accordingly for stacking),
   it should NOT have an enchantment except in the rarest of cases. If you want it to carry AC, please put a magical
   armor bonus instead.


   -standard in-area items (non-boss drops) may sometimes pick up a secondary bonus as well, but usually these would
   be only one, usually at a lesser rate, or none at all. Eg/ a L30+ in-area item may be +5 with no bonuses,
   or with a +2 to stealth.


   -soloable boss-type items should generally pick up at least one full-rate secondary perk, or two if they are below
   the recommended rate. Remember that due to non-stacking bonuses, it is usually more beneficial to a player to have
   one big bonus rather than a bunch of little ones. Eg/ a L30+ boss item may be +5 enchantment, and in addition may
   include a +3 bonus to a saving throw, or +1/2 to all saves.


   -major boss-fights written to be non-soloable would be recommended to pick up two full-rate bonuses, rather than one,
   to represent the additional challenge, or three bonuses if they are below the full recommended rate. Eg/ a L30+ group
   boss (such as Arkhon) may give a +5 item with +3 to two skills, or +2 to a couple skills and a stat. Again, it's
   usually more to a player's benefit to have two large perks rather than three small ones.

   --------------------------------------------------


   Specific rates for bonus types:

   Enchantments: while they can be worn at +1/5 levels, area drop rates should be aimed at +1/7 levels. Thus, we should
   only see +3 items start appearing in L20+ areas, and +5 only mid 30's zones. This also means when the cap is boosted
   that we may potentially see up to +7 items as accessible drops, although these should only be on the very upper-most
   fights at L50 (ie Klauth & similar).


   Stats: given the relevance to our 3e-based stat system, these should only drop in even numbers (+2, +4, +6 - please
   do not implement odd numbers), and should scale at minimum +2/15 levels. Thereby, +2 items should only be found
   from areas L15+; +4 items should only be found from areas L30+; +6 items should only be found in areas L45+.


   Skills, saving throws: both of these areas work on a d20 and thereby become intensely valuable with only a few
   points, so need to be kept limited. Bonuses should only be granted at approx +1/10 level areas; this should
   give only the very best and rarest at +5 on the uppermost endgame creatures at the L50 cap.


   AC bonus, attack bonus, damage bonus, damage resistance: these quickly accumulate, given they affect all hits
   in a round, so need to be even more limited, recommended at approx +1/12 level areas. To this end in our L40-capped
   version the highest ever itemised was +3 (L35+ areas such as Arkhon), and should never exceed +4, only found on the
   uppermost endgame creatures at the L50 cap.


   Empowered or bonus spell slots: needs to be kept very limited as this stacks up quickly, particularly with
   multiclasses; recommended scaling +1/15 level areas. To this end in our L40-capped version the high-end items
   are +2, while endgame to the L50 cap will allow for +3 in L45+ areas.


   Spell penetration, magic resistance, and various resistance types: these are still on an opposed-percentage-based
   system, so need heavier values than most other perks to be equally relevant. Recommended scaling is in +10 increments
   at +10/15 levels; to this end +20 items should only be at L30+ areas, and +30 items only in the upper ends of the
   levelcap at L45+.


   ShieldMiss: this one should not scale in the same way as alternatives, specifically due to the fact that it is
   100-capped-percentage-system - no opposing stat will offset the benefit. Existing shields give 15-30% as a
   base figure (depending on size), and shieldMiss is additive & should thus only apply a small percentage at
   any level to remain reasonable. Recommended 10-20 only to apply here, as a tower shield with a 20 shieldMiss
   stat will instantly have the player blocking half of the attacks thrown at them regardless of level.


   Sight bonus: this one does not have critical scaling limits since it doesn't convey a direct combat boost.
   However to put it in perspective, +1-2 is a normal boost to a human & a reliable edge to an elf; +3-4 is a
   sizeable boost to allow most races to see in most conditions, and +5 tend to be rare/high-end items that
   give vision in nearly all circumstances.
